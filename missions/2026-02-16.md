### 🚀 Step-by-Step Instructions

**Execute these steps through Claude Code:**

#### Step 1: Create Agent Framework

Build the core agent structure

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ClawBoz/overnight-agent
cd ~/ClawBoz/overnight-agent
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install schedule apscheduler
touch agent.py tasks.py config.json
```

**Success Checklist:**
- [ ] Project structure created
- [ ] Scheduling library installed
- [ ] Config file ready

#### Step 2: Implement Task System

Create task queue and executor

```bash
# In tasks.py, create:
# - Task base class with execute() method

# - Built-in tasks: WebScraper, DataFetcher, Analyzer
# - Result logging to JSON
```

**Success Checklist:**
- [ ] Task base class works
- [ ] Task queue manages tasks
- [ ] At least 2 example tasks implemented
- [ ] Results are logged

#### Step 3: Add Scheduling and Error Handling

Make agent run reliably overnight

```bash
# In agent.py, add:
# - Scheduler that runs tasks at specified times
# - Crash recovery (restart on error)
# - Health checks and status logging
# - Graceful shutdown handling
```

**Success Checklist:**
- [ ] Scheduler runs tasks automatically
- [ ] Errors are caught and logged
- [ ] Agent restarts after crashes
- [ ] Status updates are visible

#### Step 4: Set Up System Service

Configure agent to run on boot

```bash
# For macOS (launchd):
# Create ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.clawboz.agent.plist
# launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.clawboz.agent.plist
#
# For Linux (systemd):
# Create /etc/systemd/system/clawboz-agent.service
# systemctl enable clawboz-agent
# systemctl start clawboz-agent
```

**Success Checklist:**
