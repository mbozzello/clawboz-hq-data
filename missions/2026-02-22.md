# - get_context(query) - retrieve relevant context
# - add_document(path) - index new document
```

**Success Checklist:**
- [ ] Semantic search returns relevant results
- [ ] Related documents found accurately
- [ ] Can add new documents dynamically
- [ ] Context retrieval works for Claude

#### Step 4: Index Your Documents

Populate knowledge base with your files

```bash
# Point indexer at your documents:
python indexer.py ~/Documents
python indexer.py ~/Notes
python indexer.py ~/Downloads/*.pdf
# Verify indexing:
# Check indices/ directory for ChromaDB files
```

**Success Checklist:**
- [ ] All target directories indexed
- [ ] Embeddings stored successfully
- [ ] Can verify document count
- [ ] Search works on indexed content

#### Step 5: Query Through Claude

Use Claude to search your knowledge

```bash
# Register MCP server
