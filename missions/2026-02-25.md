- Unified search across all data sources
- Cached responses for faster queries

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed
- GitHub account (for API token)

### 🚀 Step-by-Step Instructions

**Execute these steps through Claude Code:**

#### Step 1: Create Project Structure

Set up the MCP server project

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ClawBoz/data-mcp
cd ~/ClawBoz/data-mcp

# - find_complexity_hotspots(path) - high complexity files
# - get_dependency_graph(path) - import relationships
# - find_duplicates(path) - detect code duplication
```

**Success Checklist:**
- [ ] File analysis returns metrics
- [ ] Directory analysis works recursively
- [ ] Can identify complex code
- [ ] Dependency graph generated

#### Step 4: Test on Real Codebases

Analyze your own projects

```bash
# Register MCP server with Claude
# Ask Claude to:
# 'Analyze the ClawBoz dashboard codebase'
# 'Find the most complex functions'
# 'Show me the dependency graph'
# 'Detect any code smells or anti-patterns'
```
