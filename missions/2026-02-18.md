- Claude can query GitHub trends, HN top stories, and RSS feeds
- Unified search across all data sources
- Cached responses for faster queries

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed
- GitHub account (for API token)

### 🚀 Step-by-Step Instructions

**Execute these steps through Claude Code:**

#### Step 1: Create Project Structure

Set up the MCP server project

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ClawBoz/data-mcp
cd ~/ClawBoz/data-mcp

#### Step 2: Implement Data Source Connectors

Create functions to fetch from each API

```bash
# Ask Claude Code to create:

# - fetch_rss_feed(url) - parses any RSS feed
# All should return normalized JSON format
```

**Success Checklist:**
- [ ] GitHub trending fetcher works

# - search_all(query) - searches across all sources
```

**Success Checklist:**
- [ ] MCP server class implemented
- [ ] All 4 tools defined and working

- [ ] Tree-sitter installed for AST parsing
- [ ] Code metrics tools installed

#### Step 2: Implement Code Parsers

Create parsers for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript

```bash
# Create parsers.py with:
# - parse_python(file_path) - extracts functions, classes, imports
# - parse_javascript(file_path) - same for JS/TS
# - calculate_complexity(file_path) - cyclomatic complexity
# - detect_patterns(code) - find common patterns/anti-patterns
```

**Success Checklist:**
- [ ] Python parser extracts structure
- [ ] JavaScript/TypeScript parser works
- [ ] Complexity calculation accurate
- [ ] Pattern detection finds issues

#### Step 3: Build Analysis Tools

Create MCP tools for codebase insights

```bash
# In server.py, create tools:
# - analyze_file(path) - full file analysis
# - analyze_directory(path) - recursive analysis
# - find_complexity_hotspots(path) - high complexity files
# - get_dependency_graph(path) - import relationships
# - find_duplicates(path) - detect code duplication
```

**Success Checklist:**
- [ ] File analysis returns metrics
- [ ] Directory analysis works recursively
- [ ] Can identify complex code
- [ ] Dependency graph generated

#### Step 4: Test on Real Codebases

Analyze your own projects

```bash
# Register MCP server with Claude
# Ask Claude to:
# 'Analyze the ClawBoz dashboard codebase'
# 'Find the most complex functions'
# 'Show me the dependency graph'
# 'Detect any code smells or anti-patterns'
```

**Success Checklist:**
- [ ] Can analyze real codebases
- [ ] Metrics are accurate
- [ ] Insights are actionable
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

### 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] Claude can analyze any codebase through MCP
