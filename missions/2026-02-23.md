# launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.clawboz.agent.plist
#
# For Linux (systemd):
# Create /etc/systemd/system/clawboz-agent.service
# systemctl enable clawboz-agent
# systemctl start clawboz-agent
```

**Success Checklist:**
- [ ] Service file created
- [ ] Agent starts on boot
- [ ] Can view logs
- [ ] Can stop/start/restart agent

#### Step 5: Create Morning Report

Generate and deliver daily summary

```bash
# Add report.py that:
# - Collects all overnight task results
